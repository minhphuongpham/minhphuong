This is my first project in my company. Our aim is classified an image to two categories: NOT GOOD or OK with some criterias:
For NOT GOOD images: person with uniform, offensive, not clearly face, children, image with informations, more than 2 people,...
For OK images: selfie image, person with clearly face, animals, comic, ...
The data sample is very diversity with 50000 NOT GOOD images and 40000 OK images.
First, I tried to imitate model like Mnist to classify first 300 NG and 300 OK images. The result for first model is approximately
92% (just 600 pics).
With bigger data set, I tried some model like VGG19, Densenet, Resnet101, ... to choose the best result.
